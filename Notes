osi model 7 layers = Application - SSH HTTTPS ect, Presentaton, Session - Connection, Transport - TCP & UDP, Network - How networks talk IPV4 IPV6 ICMP routing protocols, Data Link - Mac Address, Physical
PDU (Protocol Data Unit) Physical = Bit, Data Link = Frame, Network = Packet, Transport = Segment/Datagram, Session-Application = Data
iana is in charged of domain space and manages dns
ieee 
rfc (request for comment)
binary groupings are bit 1, nibble 4, byte 8, half word 16, word 32
base64 characters have a binary value associated to it a-z 0-9 + / = means known vakue
Topologies 
  Bus 
  Star all machines plugged into a center switch
  Ring Topology keeps going all mavhines connected in a ring
  Mesh is simaitar to star without a center swith there are partial mesh and full mesh where everybox is connected
  wireless is a topology with center being an ap 
  Hierarchial (used by most companies) access layer for users, distribution layer, core layer
Devices
  Hub put in info in one and broadcast info to all connected devices
  Repeater extands signal cable but degredation of quality may occur
  Switches can support different organizational units no ip needed uses mac addressing and can create vlans, creates cam table by reading source mac and adding it to its table and sends traffic to dest mac
  Routers have routing tables that is a collection of ipv4, ipv6 addresses
Ethernet Tming
  10 Mbps 100 ns
  100Mbps 10ns
  1 Gbps 1ns
  10 Gbps .1ns
  100 Gbps .01ns
Ethernet = 802.3(x) Wireless 802.11(x) Token Ring 802.5
Encapsulation and Decapsulation occurs with ip header
mac address is 48 bit | 6 B | 12 hex first 24 bits is oui anf last 24 is vendor specific, mac address do not transfer between routers
mac address type unicast 1 to 1 - 8th bit is off, multicast 1 to many 8th bit on, broadcast 1 to all all bits on
0x0800 = IPv4, 0x86DD = IPv6, 0x0806 = ARP, 0x8100 VLAN tag
for multiple vlan 0x88A8 ust be before 0x8100
Arp cache is dynamic and can last up to 20 mins and at minimum default gateway will be in arp cache
VLAN Trunking Protocol is proprietary to cisco
Dynamic Trunking Protocol cisco proprietary and is on by default
Cisco Discovery Protocol
Foundry Discovery Protocol
Link Layer Discovery Protocol
Spanning Tree Protocol 802.11D, Per VLAN Spanning TREE +, 802.1w Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol, Rapid Per VLAN Spanning Tree +, 802.1s Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol
Port Security modes are Shutdown(default), Protect, Restrict
BPDU(Bridge protocol Data Unit) is whats sent by bridge iot create root bridge used by dtp, vtp, stp, cdp, fdp to communicate

Offset value formula for fragmented packets (MTU-(IHL*4))/8
IHL are in length of words 32bits 
APIPA 169.254.0.0/16

types of vpn include remote access(client-to-site), site to site
ssh asymmetric or pki for key exchange, user key and host key are asymmetric while session key is symmetric
ssh known host database is in ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh config files /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/ssh/sshd.config
HTTP 80 clear text no encryption
HTTPS 443 encrypted
both use user request mthods GET/HEAD/POST/PUT
DNS TCP/UDP 53 UDP is for queries and TCP is for zone transfer
  dns records are
  A - IPV$ record
  AAAA - IPV6 record
  MX - Mail Server record
  TXT - human readable text
  NS - Name Server record
  SOA - tart of Authority
DHCPV4
  DORA is the acronym
  Discorver (Broadcast)

Socket types include user space and kernel space
  user space ae stream socket (TCP) & datagram sockt (UDP)
  kernel space are raw sockets require elevated perms
